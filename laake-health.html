      <h2>Laake Health: AI autonomous medical coding system for healthcare</h2>
      <p class="project-description">
        Medical coding is traditionally manual and error-prone - we automated
        that, ensuring speed and accuracy. The challenge is that out-of-the-box
        LLM doesn't generate reliable, deterministic output. Through combining
        rule-based decision paths with LLM's chain of thoughts, we break down
        medical coding into letter-by-letter steps. We have interactive
        highlights tracing back to the original source, making each coding
        decision easy to verify.
