      <h2>fooooof: Meet your friend of friend for social networking</h2>
      <p class="project-description">
        We face a paradox where social media promises to amplify voices and the
        <em>social</em> aspect of our lives, yet it subsumes individuals into an
        anonymous, de-individualized public. We created fooooof to rediscover
        personal, individualized relationships again. It takes in a userâ€™s
        location, and processes friends of friends through a graph-based
        database and deep-learning recommender systems. Since the
        recommendations are friend-sourced and collaboratively filtered,
        profiles likely share similar communities, interests and aspirations,
        adding a new layer of possibility to social computing, mediating between
        the virtual and real.
