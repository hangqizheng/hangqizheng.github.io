      <p class="project-description">
        Sequential problems are pervasive, from apartment hunting to hiring
        candidates. Humans encounter these complex cognitive tasks daily,
        internalize them, and react accordingly. Understanding how people make
        decisions in the era of human-computer interaction is becoming
        increasingly important. Drawing from the secretary problem, I explored
        historical studies in this space and used statistical simulations to
        model decision-making. Understanding cognitive processes and
        decision-making serves a solid theoretical foundation for addressing
        critical informational challenges and designing interfaces that help
        humans formulate information entities with context awareness.
