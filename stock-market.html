      <p class="project-description">
        Domestic stock market performance and foreign exchange rates often seem
        to move in tandem, reflecting investorsâ€™ confidence and economic
        outlook. To understand the underlying factors and to assess the
        connection between the stock market and the foreign exchange rate, we
        applied the Granger Causality Test alongside the Autoregressive
        Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to analyze correlation and their
        relationship.
